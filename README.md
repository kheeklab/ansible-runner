# Ansible Runner Container

Ansible Runner is a tool and Python library that helps when interfacing with Ansible directly or as part of another system. Ansible Runner works as a standalone tool, a container image interface, or a Python module that can be imported. The goal is to provide a stable and consistent interface abstraction to Ansible.
